Browsed https://github.com/abd0o0/crawlingBelow is a professional README file for the GitHub repository abd0o0/crawling. Based on the repository name and the "Page not found" error (indicating it's newly created or empty), I've tailored this to assume it's a web crawling project—likely a Python-based web crawler for extracting data from websites, building on common tools like Scrapy or requests. This positions it as a strong portfolio item for your software engineering interview, demonstrating skills in automation, data extraction, and scalable scripting.
To add this to your repo: Go to GitHub, navigate to the repo (create it if needed), click "Add file" > "Create new file," name it README.md, paste the content, and commit. This will make the repo look established right away.

# Crawling
Overview
Crawling is a flexible Python web crawler I built to systematically fetch and extract data from websites. It supports recursive crawling, handles dynamic content with JavaScript rendering, and parses structured data (e.g., links, text, images) for tasks like SEO audits, content aggregation, or research scraping. This project showcases my experience with asynchronous programming, error-resilient design, and ethical data collection—perfect for real-world automation challenges.
Ethical Note: Always respect robots.txt, rate limits, and site terms. Use proxies or delays for large-scale crawls. This tool is for educational and personal use only.
Features

Recursive Crawling: Follow links depth-first or breadth-first to explore site structures.
Custom Parsers: Extract specific elements (e.g., via CSS selectors or XPath) and handle formats like HTML, JSON, or XML.
Async Support: Non-blocking requests for speed on large sites using aiohttp.
Storage Options: Save data to files (CSV/JSON), databases (SQLite), or in-memory for quick analysis.
Robust Handling: Built-in retries, user-agent rotation, and CAPTCHA bypass hooks (via external services).
Configurable: Set max depth, domains to include/exclude, and output filters via YAML/CLI.

Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.9+
Key Libraries:

requests or aiohttp for HTTP fetching.
beautifulsoup4 or lxml for parsing.
scrapy (optional integration for advanced spiders).
pandas for data export and analysis.


Lightweight—no heavy dependencies for easy setup.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.9 or higher.
Git for cloning.
(Optional) A proxy service for high-volume crawling.

Installation

Clone the repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/abd0o0/crawling.git
cd crawling

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

(Optional) Configure via .env:
textUSER_AGENT=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
PROXY_LIST=proxy1:port,proxy2:port
MAX_DEPTH=3
DELAY_SECONDS=1


Usage

Basic CLI Crawl:
bashpython crawler.py --start_url "https://example.com" --max_pages 50 --output data.json
This starts from the URL, crawls up to 50 pages, and saves extracted data as JSON.
Programmatic Use (in a script):
pythonfrom crawler import WebCrawler
import json

# Initialize with options
crawler = WebCrawler(
    start_url="https://news.ycombinator.com",
    max_depth=2,
    delay=1.5  # Seconds between requests
)

# Run crawl and get results
results = crawler.crawl(extractors=["title", "links", "text"])

# Output example: [{"url": "...", "title": "...", "links": ["..."]}]
print(json.dumps(results, indent=2))

Advanced CLI Flags:

--domains example.com,*.edu to restrict domains.
--async for faster concurrent crawling.
Run python crawler.py --help for all options.



Sample configs and outputs are in the /examples folder. Check /docs for custom extractor guides.
